## Rules

+ All non-translated keys (keys with `null` or `~` as values) will fallback to EN.
+ You also need to provide the modified file **as-is** without **any extensions modifications** or **renames**.
+ Only **values** of keys must be modified.
+ No key should be added.
+ `null` value means the actual transition of a key is **unknown**
+ `~` value means the key is the same in English. Don't replace it to add an English translation, it'll fallback to EN anyway.
+ Variables **SHOULD NOT BE TRANSLATED** (values between curly braces)

**NEVER USE AN EMPTY VALUE WHEN TRANSLATING A KEY**

Don't hesitate to fix missing values!

Thanks in advance, \
NosWings Team.
